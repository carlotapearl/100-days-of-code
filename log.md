# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Grow with Google Udacity Developer Challenge

* [Full Guidelines for the Challenge](https://sites.google.com/udacity.com/gwgdevscholarship/community/100-days-of-code-challenge)

### Day 1: June 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started preparing for Project 3.  Reviewed code from several lessons in Part 3 of Udacity's Front End Nano Degree program in preparation to dive into project 3. I noticed I had skiped several lessons of the Accessibilty lessons that required downloading the code and making it accessible. Then I moved on to set approach Project 3. I started a Google Spreadsheet document (will share link later) with tabs for Instructions, Resources, thoughts, Steps...and so on. I created one for Project 2 and it was very helpful. 

**Thoughts:** Excited about day one of the challenge. Although I have been doing some form of Web Dev since 2012 and have been coding almost every day for the past 2 years (first with FreeCodeCamp then through attending The Iron Yard Immersive Bootcamp), I have never done an official 100 Days of Code challenge. I am very excited to take the challenge.  Excited to be part of it with my Udacity Cohort as well as the entire Udacity Grow With Google Dev Scholars!

### Day 2: June 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued to review the lessons in Part 3 for use with Project 3 for Udacity's Front End Nano Degree. I finished lessons 10 -Functions, 11 -Built-ins, and 12 -Professional Developer-fu. I still need to go back and finish a few quizes for lesson's 7, 8, & 9. 

**Thoughts:** Since I have a planned get-away to the beach this weekend I got up early and coded for about 8 hours today! I am super chaged to continue this challenge of 100DaysOfCode! 

### Day 3: June 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Clompleted Udacity's Nano Degree Part 3 Lesson 7 Objects in Depth. 

**Thoughts:** I had already gone over the material without completing the code challenges. Today I spent about 2 hours going through the material and completing all of the quizes. I am pretty happy with my understanding of the material.

### Day 4: June 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Clompleted Udacity's Object Oriented JavaScript: Functions at Runtime Lesson. The lesson included the following topics: First-Class Functions, Callbacks, Scope, and Closures as well as Immediately-Invoked Function Expressions.

### Day 5: July 01, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed the JavaScript Functions Lesson (all 21 parts) of my Udacity Front End Nano Degree curriculum. Some of the exercises I worked on covered ES6 arrow functions, the "this" keyword in regular functions as well as "this" in arrow functions. Also covered how to use default function parameters to pass default values to functions, Destructuring, and JavaScript classes.

**Thoughts** Udacity's does a fine job explaining all the new things to JavaScript Functions in ES6.


### Day 6: July 02, 2018
