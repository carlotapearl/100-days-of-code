# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Grow with Google Udacity Developer Challenge

* [Full Guidelines for the Challenge](https://sites.google.com/udacity.com/gwgdevscholarship/community/100-days-of-code-challenge)

### Day 1: June 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started preparing for Project 3.  Reviewed code from several lessons in Part 3 of Udacity's Front End Nano Degree program in preparation to dive into project 3. I noticed I had skiped several lessons of the Accessibilty lessons that required downloading the code and making it accessible. Then I moved on to set approach Project 3. I started a Google Spreadsheet document (will share link later) with tabs for Instructions, Resources, thoughts, Steps...and so on. I created one for Project 2 and it was very helpful. 

**Thoughts:** Excited about day one of the challenge. Although I have been doing some form of Web Dev since 2012 and have been coding almost every day for the past 2 years (first with FreeCodeCamp then through attending The Iron Yard Immersive Bootcamp), I have never done an official 100 Days of Code challenge. I am very excited to take the challenge.  Excited to be part of it with my Udacity Cohort as well as the entire Udacity Grow With Google Dev Scholars!

### Day 2: June 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued to review the lessons in Part 3 for use with Project 3 for Udacity's Front End Nano Degree. I finished lessons 10 -Functions, 11 -Built-ins, and 12 -Professional Developer-fu. I still need to go back and finish a few quizes for lesson's 7, 8, & 9. 

**Thoughts:** Since I have a planned get-away to the beach this weekend I got up early and coded for about 8 hours today! I am super chaged to continue this challenge of 100DaysOfCode! 

### Day 3: June 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Clompleted Udacity's Nano Degree Part 3 Lesson 7 Objects in Depth. 

**Thoughts:** I had already gone over the material without completing the code challenges. Today I spent about 2 hours going through the material and completing all of the quizes. I am pretty happy with my understanding of the material.
