# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Grow with Google Udacity Developer Challenge

* [Full Guidelines for the Challenge](https://sites.google.com/udacity.com/gwgdevscholarship/community/100-days-of-code-challenge)

### Day 1: June 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started preparing for Project 3.  Reviewed code from several lessons in Part 3 of Udacity's Front End Nano Degree program in preparation to dive into project 3. I noticed I had skiped several lessons of the Accessibilty lessons that required downloading the code and making it accessible. Then I moved on to set approach Project 3. I started a Google Spreadsheet document (will share link later) with tabs for Instructions, Resources, thoughts, Steps...and so on. I created one for Project 2 and it was very helpful. 

**Thoughts:** Excited about day one of the challenge. Although I have been doing some form of Web Dev since 2012 and have been coding almost every day for the past 2 years (first with FreeCodeCamp then through attending The Iron Yard Immersive Bootcamp), I have never done an official 100 Days of Code challenge. I am very excited to take the challenge.  Excited to be part of it with my Udacity Cohort as well as the entire Udacity Grow With Google Dev Scholars!

### Day 2: June 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued to review the lessons in Part 3 for use with Project 3 for Udacity's Front End Nano Degree. I finished lessons 10 -Functions, 11 -Built-ins, and 12 -Professional Developer-fu. I still need to go back and finish a few quizes for lesson's 7, 8, & 9. 

**Thoughts:** Since I have a planned get-away to the beach this weekend I got up early and coded for about 8 hours today! I am super chaged to continue this challenge of 100DaysOfCode! 

### Day 3: June 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Clompleted Udacity's Nano Degree Part 3 Lesson 7 Objects in Depth. 

**Thoughts:** I had already gone over the material without completing the code challenges. Today I spent about 2 hours going through the material and completing all of the quizes. I am pretty happy with my understanding of the material.

### Day 4: June 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Clompleted Udacity's Object Oriented JavaScript: Functions at Runtime Lesson. The lesson included the following topics: First-Class Functions, Callbacks, Scope, and Closures as well as Immediately-Invoked Function Expressions.

### Day 5: July 01, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed the JavaScript Functions Lesson (all 21 parts) of my Udacity Front End Nano Degree curriculum. Some of the exercises I worked on covered ES6 arrow functions, the "this" keyword in regular functions as well as "this" in arrow functions. Also covered how to use default function parameters to pass default values to functions, Destructuring, and JavaScript classes.

**Thoughts** Udacity's does a fine job explaining all the new things to JavaScript Functions in ES6.


### Day 6: July 02, 2018

### Day 16: July 12, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued with Udacity's Front End Nano Degree course work. My project was reviewed and met expectations on the first submission. Today I was able to complete 3 Lessons: Web Tooling and Automation, Productive Editing, and Powerful Builds. These included setting up the IDE with packages to increase productivity (keyboard shortcuts and code editor extensions to speed up development process. In the afternoon I spent several hours in the "Powerful Builds" lesson which included setting up Gulp and Sass.

**Thoughts:** I had used Gulp, NPM, NodeJs, and Sass prior to this lesson. Having set up a new computer recently I did fresh installs for all of these today. I also went back to Lynda.com and finished "Sass Essential Training" and another for Workflows with Git, Gulp, and Browserify. All in all it was a very productive day.

### Day 17: July 13, 2018

I completed the first 10 parts, which included version 1 and 2 of a "Cat Clicker App". I have included the code here.

### Day 25 - 30  July 21 - 26, 2018

**Progress**: Worked on Udacity's JavaScript Patterns Course for the Front End Nano Degree. Also complete's Lynda.com's new course, "Learning Functional Programming with JavaScript".

### Day 31 - 32 July 27 - 28, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Udacity's JavaScript Promises Course. I noticed that the course was created in 2015, I compared my notes to my lessons at The Iron Yard Bootcamp from 2017 and found a fantastic workshop on Lynda.com called, "Rethinking Asynchronous JavaScript", taught by Kyle Simpson.

** Thoughts: **
Kyle says, "Youâ€™ve got to get through the promises and generators. That is the new baseline for competency in asynchronous programming, is understanding what promises are, what generators are, and why the two need to be mixed together to solve the issues of callback hell. That's the new standard for competency." There are a lot of code exersices in this workshop. I am glad to have found it.

### Day 33 July 29, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Returned to Udacity's JavaScript Patterns course to finish up the revisions to the Cat Clicker app. Refactored the MVC and Premium Pro versions.  

** Thoughts: **
The important lesson leaned today is that when you plan ahead and organize things well it is much easier to add things later.
I was able to go back and quickly add new features.
