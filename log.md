# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Grow with Google Udacity Developer Challenge

### Day 1: June 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started preparing for Project 3.  Reviewed code from several lessons in Part 3 of Udacity's Front End Nano Degree program in preparation to dive into project 3. I noticed I had skiped several lessons of the Accessibilty lessons that required downloading the code and making it accessible. Then I moved on to set approach Project 3. I started a Google Spreadsheet document (will share link later) with tabs for Instructions, Resources, thoughts, Steps...and so on. I created one for Project 2 and it was very helpful. 

**Thoughts:** Excited about day one of the challenge. Although I have been doing some form of Web Dev since 2012 and have been coding almost every day for the past 2 years (first with FreeCodeCamp then through attending The Iron Yard Immersive Bootcamp), I have never done an official 100 Days of Code challenge. I am very excited to take the challenge.  Excited to be part of it with my Udacity Cohort as well as the entire Udacity Grow With Google Dev Scholars!
